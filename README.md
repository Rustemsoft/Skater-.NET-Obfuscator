This comprehensive professional solution ensures the protection of .NET applications, including both .NET Core and .NET Framework. By using Skater .NET Obfuscator, developers can effectively safeguard their Microsoft .NET applications from reverse engineering, code modification, and intellectual property theft. The obfuscation process renders the application code more secure and unreadable, as the program logic becomes highly confusing post-obfuscation. The tool supports multiple obfuscation methods such as DLL obfuscation, executable obfuscation, Control Flow obfuscation, String Encryption, Reference obfuscation, and MetaData obfuscation. It ensures that all namespaces, classes, methods, variable names, and custom attributes in the .NET application are obfuscated. 

Skater .NET Obfuscator also allows for the exclusion of specific code segments from the obfuscation process. Developers can configure assembly settings to exclude certain parts as needed. Additionally, the Skater Visual Studio .NET integration module facilitates seamless debugging of obfuscated .NET applications within Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. This module enables step-by-step debugging without the need to deobfuscate the software first, even if only parts of the code are obfuscated.

While the protected .NET project retains compatibility with older languages and frameworks, developers may encounter challenges when using incompatible older frameworks. For example, creating a project in C# and packaging it with NuGet in VB.NET, or vice versa, may present compatibility issues. Rustemsoft developed the .NET obfuscator to hinder reverse engineers from understanding or decompiling .NET code. The goal is to prevent unauthorized individuals from writing code that plagiarizes intellectual property. Essentially, this tool ensures that other developers cannot access or comprehend the inner workings of the newly written program.

The C# obfuscator processes code through a series of functions and subroutines, making it difficult to read, track, and understand. Skater obfuscator adds meaningless characters to the program's letters, originally designed for security auditing and penetration testing. While some use it to conceal sensitive information within source code, making it harder for outsiders to discover, others use it purely for amusement.
